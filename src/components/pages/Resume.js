        <p>
          My name is Alan Phelps, and I am currently in the process of becoming
          a full-stack web-developer through the University of Richmond's Coding
          Bootcamp program. I have many years of working experience, from
          selling books to making coffee, from facilitating a high ropes course
          to teaching Latin. I'm resourceful, inquisitive, and efficient. If you
          are a good employer looking for a viable candidate for a
          web-development position, I'm your guy!
